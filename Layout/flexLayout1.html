                <p>On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) 
                    as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only license. 
                    On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available
                     under free software/open-source distribution terms, 
                    aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.
